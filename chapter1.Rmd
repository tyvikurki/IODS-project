*How are you feeling right now? What do you expect to learn? Where did you hear about the course?*  

* I feel like
  + I'm going to learn a lot
  + I might need some help along the way
  
* A friend of mine
  + told me about the course and
  + encouraged me to participate
  
***

*Also reflect on your learning experiences with the R for Health Data Science book and the Exercise Set 1: How did it work as a "crash course" on modern R tools and using RStudio? Which were your favorite topics? Which topics were most difficult? Some other comments on the book and our new approach of getting started with R Markdown etc.?*  

* The book is really nice because
  + the examples are clear and well explained
 
* In addition
  + for me, it really helps to have the code ready and to be able to try them for myself while reading
  + nothing has been "difficult", although there were many things that I've never seen or tried before
